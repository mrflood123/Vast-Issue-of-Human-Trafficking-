<h1><strong> Human Trafficking</strong></h1>
<h2><em>Michela Flood</em></h2>

<p> Human trafficking is the illegal trading of humans for the purpose of abundant labor, sexual slavery, or exploitation. Posing as a huge social problem, relevant worldwide. This idea of trading innocent people and lives, completely disregards humanity, and makes both adults and children a product rather than a life. 

Resources like the FBI, and The National Human Trafficking Hotline, serve as resources for anyone who may be victimized from the issue. The National Human Trafficking Hotline records data through the amount of signals the trafficking hotline receives, as such would contribute to understanding if levels are increasing or decreasing. Many hotlines use this strategy to measure data and understand how higher reports, means higher rates. There are many places’ individuals can turn to nation-wide for support. 

When it comes to children, there are many safe centers and spaces for them to access help. As such, Human Trafficking resources are not only limited to the big-name corporations. Places like the McMahon Ryan Child Advocacy Center in Syracuse NY works to be an outlet for children who fall victim to the problem. The center, at 601 East Genesee St works with law enforcement, child services, family services, medical professionals, victim advocates, prosecutors, therapists, and volunteers to support children on all levels of abuse, including human trafficking. 

Erin Bates, the Deputy Director of Operations, Strategies, & Policies at the center is no stranger to the complicated nature human trafficking develops. Erin’s work started with the center 10 years ago, where she initially served solely in the trafficking program. “If people know of us that means they have experienced the trauma that is sex abuse or physical abuse.” All reports of physical or sexual abuse get reported to the center. The center prioritizes not re-traumatizing children, where promoting comfort, and safety for these children to be open is necessary. The child friendly and equipped center is designed so kids are strategically interviewed and conversed with to determine the problem and if there is abuse present. “The goal is that the child only comes in here once.” 

Where every situation is circumstantial, working with the local children's hospital and Syracuse law enforcement to solve issues is non-negotiable. With two nationally renowned Child Abuse Pediatricians, who have done specialized training to look at and diagnose child abuse and a plethora of employees, and specialized workers, a child's well-being is always the priority. 

With many moving parts the center organizes different levels of service by floor. Including three human trafficking advocates, the program began in 2013. When Onondaga County was given money by the state to do Safe Harbor Work (dealing with children who have risk of or have been exploited). “That is really where our program started, and overall, my experience has been with children who are at risk or have been trafficked.”  The Safe Harbor Program was issued to reach kids up to 21 years of age for assistance, rather than stopping the age gap at 18. Valuing, help for longer years, rather than stopping when kids reach the presumed “adult age.” 

The center with 60+ employees is composed of workers who are willing to take care of themselves, and stay strong, as this type of work could take an emotional toll very quickly. Erin defines human trafficking as way more than this kidnapping, sex exploitation, and involuntary human movement. The center seeks to make a simple, clear, understandable definition, to the issue. “Any action a third party can profit from that is induced from force, fraud, or coercion.” This third party is referring to how the trafficking occurs, and in any legal proceeding what prosecution is looking to dismantle during the process. Once there is evidence on this basis, and the person is under 18 they are automatically considered a victim of trafficking. Whereas over 18 this idea of force, fraud, or cohesion, needs to be proved. Child protective services must screen and access every child on their caseload for trafficking, then measuring with a abuse scale or this force fraud, and coercion dynamic, determines if it would be categorized as such. “The issue is a lot of these youth feel like they can trust or that they are in a relationship with whomever is doing this to them, so a lot of the times, they don't want to interact with law enforcement, because they don't believe they are in any sort of danger or that anything wrong is being done to them.” The goal as a program is to promote safe adult relationships. 

All victims are given a choice to work with or not work with the center, where they are encouraged to take the help and support. Oftentimes however, building comfort is a long road. With this kind of work, stopping is not an option. “Our program is very focused on the grassroots, boots to the ground, like you're not sitting in an office unless you are doing notes, data, or reporting.” Human trafficking advocates are rarely at the center, their day consists of meeting with clients, transportation to appointments, meeting with parents or caregivers. 

Crisis intervention is a huge factor of this work, hosting approximately 1,500 kids a year finding a place to intervene and help is vital. Where traffickers are huge, usually advanced criminals, these people often gear towards certain demographics to exhibit their work. “The national statistic for the USA is that the average age of entry into the sex trafficking, exploitation lifestyle is 12-14, I would say unfortunately I have seen that to be true, that is about the median age for what we see.” With this young age, the majority of referrals are also female. However, in more recent years referrals in male and transgender referrals have increased.” “We know that males are being trafficked, I know that transgender youth are being trafficked, and it has been my experience that they are less likely to come forward as quickly as a female would, they are also less likely to be identified then a female would.” 

In Syracuse in particular Erin emphasizes the city has a number around 170 of unidentified youth who were considered at risk for human trafficking. Where the city undoubtedly has a problem. With a disturbing issue as vast as human trafficking, it is hard for people to believe that they can support and help mend the problem when it is just so large. However, Erin encourages this idea of speaking rather than staying quiet, as well as making known certain signs that may exhibit trafficking. “It's been my experience that if they have physical injuries, they don't have stories about these injuries. Or as far as red flags, they can't talk for themselves, they have someone with them, where their authority seems to overarch their presence, that could be a concern.” “Typically, you are looking for kind of weird tattoos too like not done professionally, money signs, lips, pimp names, street names, things like that, barcodes, are a thing, I have only ever seen one, but they exist. Unaccounted for money and goods, like if you have a 12- or 13-year-old who is walking around in Jordans, and has a brand new iPhone, and you know mom is not paying for it and they are talking about trips to the mall, that is questionable, they are either stealing or someone’s paying for it and why are they paying for it.” Knowing these signs, society can be equipped to look out for them and ask the follow up questions to make sure that people can figure out what is really going on. 

Where traffickers tend to look for anyone with a sense of vulnerability, or children whose brains are not even fully developed yet. These traffickers take someone's vulnerability and exploit it. Where a problem like human trafficking is world-wide, posing as a danger and threat to anyone in society it is vital to be aware of surroundings, and any situations where this issue could be posed, as such to support places like the McMahon Ryan Child Advocacy Center, and advocate on the issue, as no human should ever be forced to do anything in this world, and everyone deserves a chance at a quality and substantial life.
